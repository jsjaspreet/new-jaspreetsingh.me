# 2016 In Review

At the end of every year, I like to reflect on what I did that year and how I can improve moving forward. This year gave me a lot to reflect on. There were many highlights, like accepting a new job. But also many lowlights, the most prominent being too consumed with personal improvement at times to the expense of my friends. 

### New Job, New City

I left YP to start working at DataScience in Culver City this past summer. Working on the ground floor for a new product is something I've always wanted. The opportunity also allowed me to finally scratch that frontend itch I've had since I discovered React. And write a lot of front end code I did. From creating a data visualization framework from scratch to working on a brand new product that allows data scientists to collaborate better with cloud-hosted Jupyter notebooks, I delved deep into a world of code I hadn't seen in my previous backend life. In the process, I even picked up a new language or two (ES6 is love). I'm much more confident in my abilities to see through the full process of taking designs from creative professionals, writing the implementation code, to seeing through the last-mile of deployment, and for that I'm thankful. I also moved to Culver City this year. While it was rough in the beginning, it's definitely grown on me. Being 10 minutes away from the beach is an opportunity I need to take a lot more advantage of this year.

### Rocky Personal Balance

While I picked up a lot more healthier habits, I need to balance time away from work better this year. I'm proud of my meditation effort this year, made much easier thanks to Headspace. Also proud of consistently working out this year. Yet, all these self-improvement efforts came at the cost of connecting with others. Keeping in touch with friends and being open to new opportunities are some areas of improvement to focus on this year. I'm optimistic, considering the transition with work and moving are finally behind me. It's so easy to forget that life should be an adventure much more than a march from one milestone to another.

I'm looking forward to continue building amazing products and making new memories with friends and family. Let's do this 2017!
