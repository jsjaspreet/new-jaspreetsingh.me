# 2016 In Review

From shifting career gears by accepting a new job in a new city, to lifting past my previous plateaus, to undertaking meditation as a semi-regular habit, 2016 was a breakout year for me. There were definitely some situations I wish I had handled differently this year and many moments where I lost balance of my personal life while handling all the transitions, but overall I'd say it was a pretty successful year.

### New Job, New City

I left my previous company to start working at [DataScience](https://www.datascience.com) as a Software Engineer this summer. I had always wanted to learn Front End development seriously while leveraging the backend experience I gained at YP. DataScience offered a ton of learning opportunities in this regard, from creating a data visualization framework in React from scratch to working on a full product that allows users to work on Jupyter notebooks on our DataScience platform, I saw my skills grow tremendously. From barely understanding ES6, to being very comfortable with the full end-to-end process of taking designs from creative professionals, writing the code that implements the product, to seeing through the last-mile of app deployment on the Mesos platform, I can finally say I'm very confident in my abilities to work on software across many different stages of development. Beyond a new job, I also moved to Culver City which was rough in the beginning as any transition usually goes, but the area is beautiful and being 10 minutes away from LAX and the beach is an opportunity I will definitely be taking more advantage of next year.

### Personal Balance

I'm also proud of working out a lot more consistently and with greater quality this year. I wish I had tracked my Polar FT7's data more religiously as I worked out so much that it started dropping previous workouts, it contains all my workouts since June however and I've apparently gone 77 times in the past 6 months! Massive improvement over 2015. [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) has also been a semi-regularly part of my life this year, although I dropped the habit around September and only recently started picking it up again. Meditation helped me get through some rough parts this year, and books on Stoicism that I also read will surely help handle challenges in the future.

### Things to Do Better Next Year

Some areas that I believe I need to improve on are keeping in touch with friends and being more open to new opportunities, I was so intensely focused on work and self-improvement this year that I think I did a bad job keeping in touch with friends and being open/flexible enough for opportunities to make new ones. Now that a lot of the hectic transitions with changing jobs and moving to a new city are behind me however, I'm optimistic about having more mental space to be open next year. Maybe even finally make those travel plans!

I'm eager for 2017, looking forward to continue building dope software and making memories with friends and family. Let's do this.
