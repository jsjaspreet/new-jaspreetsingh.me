# 30 Days of Reinvention

In the past I've tried multiple times to "reinvent" myself, to replace bad habits with better ones and I've consistently failed to sustain the effort for more than one to two weeks at a time. In 2016, I successfully completed 30 consecutive days of self-improvement and I'd like to share some of the strategies and tools in categories I focused on for my 30 days:

### Meditation

In this category, I wanted to improve my willpower and overall mindfulness in daily life. Meditation had a tremendous impact in achieving this and many other unexpected benefits over my 30 days of self-improvement. From producing greater self-awareness to calming anxiety, meditation's overall effect of greater self-control even made all my other goals easier to achieve. For all the benefits of meditation, it can be difficult to start out as a beginner. Two beginner-friendly resources I used to sustain meditation were [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) and [Mindfulness in Plain English](https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-English-Bhante-Henepola-Gunaratana/dp/0861719069). 

[Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) is an app that offers guided and unguided meditation sessions on a variety of topics. I was hesitant to follow along guided meditation and especially through an app, but the app does a great job of teaching the basics of meditation through a "foundation" course before allowing you to focus on more specialized topics of meditation.

[Mindfulness in Plain English](https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-English-Bhante-Henepola-Gunaratana/dp/0861719069) was also useful in providing some more theory around the idea of meditation and bringing mindfulness beyond just the act of meditating, but throughout daily life. 

### Physical Health

For this goal, I wanted to learn how to workout most effectively, track my diet better, and improve sleep hygiene. The book + app combo again proved fruitful here as I found a great book, [Bigger Leaner Stronger](https://www.amazon.com/Bigger-Leaner-Stronger-Building-Ultimate/dp/1938895274), as well as an app [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com) that helped me tremendously with these goals.

[BLS](https://www.amazon.com/Bigger-Leaner-Stronger-Building-Ultimate/dp/1938895274) breaks down everything workout-related, from nutrition to mindset to which exercises to focus on if you're weightlifting in the gym (answer: compound exercises, compound exercises, and more compound exercises!). The author also lays out workout and diet plans, and after four weeks of following the BLS program, I was lifting well beyond my previous maximums and every workout left me feeling energized rather than exhausted.

For sleep, I needed a way to actually quantify how much sleep I was getting and [Sleep Cycle](https://www.sleepcycle.com) is a great way to do that. It not only records how long you're sleeping but also quantifies your quality of sleep by monitoring your breathing to assess how much deep-sleep you're getting. My favorite feature of the app is a dynamic wake alarm that wakes you up in a time range rather than at an exact time like most alarms. The dynamic aspect comes from the fact that it tries to wake you up when it senses you're furthest away from deep sleep, preventing mornings where you sleep a lot but wake up groggy because your alarm disrupted you while you were in deep sleep.

### Precommitment

This wasn't a goal as much as a strategy to help me achieve my work/health related goals. First I had to ask myself a couple questions:

Do you repeatedly engage in any activity or put yourself in a situation that you already know has a negative effect on your quality of life?

Are there people in your life that you continually experience unwarranted, unnecessary negativity around?

Precommitment has been about taking a step back, identifying situations in my life that fit the above patterns and removing myself from those situations completely. This was probably the most difficult part of the 30 day period as I had to answer many difficult personal questions and reassess relationships with people who no longer aligned with my values. There's always a fear that comes with changing old habits, but I kept remembering that I'm at my best when my external self matches my internal values, and the desire for that congruence gave me the perseverance to see things through.

### Conclusion

While some of my habits naturally lessened in intensity later on in the year, my 30 day period definitely had an overwhelmingly positive effect on life and propelled me to make some big decisions this year like getting a new job in Culver City. I hope you'll find this post useful for any personal reinvention of your own  in the future!
