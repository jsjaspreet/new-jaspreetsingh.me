# Reflections on Cal

Honestly, I didn't cheer when I saw my acceptance to Cal.

I was disappointed reading that I had been accepted as a Spring admit rather than in the Fall, and had it in my mind for a while that I'd be attending UCLA.

On a leap of faith, I chose Cal and in the end, it definitely ended up being the better decision. Looking back there were a few key lessons that stood out to me in my college experience, and I'd like to share them with you. 

### Accept the Challenge

If you never push yourself outside of your comfort zone, how will you know what you're truly capable of? UCLA was only a half hour drive away from my home town and I know the temptation of running home when things got rough in college would be too difficult for me to overcome. I knew if I really wanted to grow, I'd have to throw myself in a new environment and learn to thrive without the safety net of home. This was definitely the right decision looking back, when I finally received my diploma I felt much more proud of graduating than I would have if I took what looked like an easier option at UCLA. Key takeaway: Don't underestimate yourself and take the harder route, the reward in the end will be that much better.

### Say Hello

You never know how the people you interact with will come back to help you later on. One day while I was an intern at YP, I decided to start a random conversation with someone in the break room. This person ended up being the Executive Director of Talent Acquisition, and that initial conversation set off a series of events that ultimately concluded in my first job offer as a full time Software Engineer. That happened from some small talk by the water cooler! Being interested and open to the world around you sounds like basic advice, but so often we're so locked up in our own little worlds, we simply don't notice how valuable the people around us really are.

### Try Something New

Every semester of college was an opportunity to try something completely new. I wish I had taken even more advantages of this (It's not so easy to learn archery at the work place unfortunately). My favorite memories at Cal were saying yes to trying something new. You may never know that you love playing Catan if you dismiss board game night as some nerd gathering, or that you're a good public speaker if you never get up in front of an audience and lend them your voice.
